The designed controller should include at least the following peripherals:
1. Minimum 8 digital inputs galvanically isolated from the microcontroller (24 V standard).
2. Minimum 8 digital outputs galvanically isolated from the microcontroller (24 V standard).
3. Minimum 2 analog inputs (±10 V range).
4. Minimum 2 analog outputs (±10 V range).
5. Minimum 1 CAN interface (isolated).
6. Minimum 1 UART interface (isolated).
7. The system should have a modular structure, meaning each peripheral should be placed on a separate printed circuit board.
